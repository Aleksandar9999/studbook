Student Book

I am creating this app for students and for those who will become students.

In this project I am using Firebase.

Students can comment, rate, upload usefull links that would help other colleagues to successfully complete the course.
Also they can rate study programs so the people who have to decide what study program to enroll, make that decidion much 
easier. 
This is a first design, I will work on it to increase my Flutter skills.
